## What This Project Is About

Getting more education doesn't always mean earning more money — what matters is whether your education actually matches your job. In Pakistan, a large share of workers are either over-qualified or under-qualified for what they do.

This project uses microdata from the Labour Force Survey 2024–25 to answer one question:

> Does education–occupation mismatch significantly affect individual monthly earnings in Pakistan?

---

## Key Findings

- Only **20% of workers** are properly matched to their jobs
- **Over-educated workers** earn **15.5% less** than matched workers despite having more education
- **Under-educated workers** earn **19.5% less** than matched workers
- **Women** earn **3.8% less** than men after controlling for everything else
- **Urban workers** earn **7.4% more** than rural workers
- Women make up only **5.6% of over-educated workers** but **22.9% of under-educated workers**

## Methodology

### Mismatch Construction (ORU Approach)
Following Duncan & Hoffman (1981), I constructed the mismatch variable by:
1. Converting education categories to years of schooling
2. Extracting ISCO-08 major occupation groups from 4-digit codes
3. Assigning required education per occupation group
4. Comparing actual vs required education

| Mismatch Status | Definition |
|---|---|
| Over-educated | Actual education > Required education |
| Under-educated | Actual education < Required education |
| Matched (base) | Actual education = Required education |

### Regression Model
ln(Income) = β0 + β1OverEdu + β2UnderEdu + β3Age + β4Age² + β5Female + β6Urban + Province FE + ε
